# Hi, I'm Katznboyz!

I develop open source software that is free to use. Some of the languages I use are Python (3.6+), HTML5, CSS3, web JavaScript, C++, CUDA C++, and SQL!

Currently, I am learning more about GPU acceleration using CUDA. My next project will be to build a web server that runs in parallel on a GPU using NVIDIA's direct network access protocol.

Speaking of web servers, I also have a fair amount of experience with Flask and Bootstrap!

Aside from programming languages, I am also familiar with Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server (18.04 and 20.04), as I used Ubuntu Desktop as my main desktop OS for almost a year, and I have been using Ubuntu Server nonstop on my homelab for almost 3 years!
