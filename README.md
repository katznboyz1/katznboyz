# hi, I'm katznboyz

I'm mostly a 3D artist, but I'll write code when I find something I can't solve by hand. I've been writing code since 7th grade, and I know quite a few languages, with Python being my strongest. I also have been doing 3D animation since 2020, and I'm working towards being a 3D environment artist as a profession.
